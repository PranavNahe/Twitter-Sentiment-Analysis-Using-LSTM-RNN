# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-LSTM-RNN

A. Introduction

Dive into the intricate realm of emotions with our project, "Twitter Sentiment Analysis using LSTM-RNN." In an era where social media is an integral part of daily life, serving as a colossal platform for expression, this project harnesses the cutting-edge technologies of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). 

B. Objective

Employ the sophisticated Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) architecture.
Decipher sentiments embedded in tweets.
Leverage LSTM's proficiency in capturing intricate temporal dependencies.

C. Approach

Data Preprocessing: The preprocessing filters out neutral sentiment instances, converts text to lowercase while removing non-alphanumeric characters, replaces 'rt' in the 'text' column, and tokenizes and sequences the text for analysis using a maximum of 2000 features.
Data Visualization: The data visualization includes a bar plot illustrating the number of positive and negative instances, a histogram displaying the distribution of text length, and a word cloud visualizing the positive and negative sentiments in the dataset.
LSTM-RNN Analysis: Harnessing the power of Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN) to decode complex sentiment patterns.

D. Dataset

The First GOP Debate Twitter Sentiment dataset is a collection of 14,000 tweets related to the 2015 Republican presidential primary debate. The dataset includes annotations for the relevance of each tweet, the candidates mentioned, the topic of the tweet, and the overall sentiment of the tweet. The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers interested in sentiment analysis, social media, and political communication.
